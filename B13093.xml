            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas at a Parliament begun and holden at Westminster the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of February, in the one and twentieth yeere of the Reigne of our late most deare and Royall Father, King <hi>Iames</hi> of euer blessed memory (amongst other good and wholesome Lawes then made and established for the Weale-publike of this Realme) it was enacted by the authority of the same Parliament, that no person or persons should from thenceforth prophanely Sweare or Curse, vnder the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties therein contained. We taking into Our Princely consideration, the great increase of those sinnes, which are the more audaciously practised, and frequently committed by loose and wicked persons, in regard the said Statute made for preuention and restraint thereof, is not constantly put in execution, Haue therefore with the aduice of Our Priuie Councill (for the better repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of those odious sinnes) by Our Letters Patents dated the one and twentieth day of Iuly last past, erected an office for the receiuing of the forfeitures incurred by such profane Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Cursers: And reposing much trust and confidence in the fidelity, industry, wisedome, and piety of Our welbeloued seruant <hi>Robert Leslie</hi> Esquire, one of the Gentlemen of our Priuie-Chamber, haue thereby ordained and appointed, that he by himselfe, or his sufficient Assignes or Deputies, and none other person (except the Iustices of Peace, Constables, Churchwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Ouerseers of the poore, and others by the said Statute authorized) shall in euery Parish within this Our Realme of England, and Dominion of Wales, attend that seruice and office, and for a certaine number of yeares therein contained, shall and may receiue the Penaltie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the said Statute, from all and euery person and persons liuing within Our said Realme and Dominion, offending against the tenor of the same (who haue not paid the said Penalty to any the persons authorized by the said Statute, to receiue the same before it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Our said seruant, his Assignes or Deputies) wherein We haue taken especiall care, that security be giuen for the faithfull collecting of those Penalties, and for a true accompt and payment of the same twice euery yeere vnto the Bishops of the Diocesses, wherein the same shall be receiued, by whose care and order the moneys thereby arising shall bee iustly distributed amongst Our poore subiects of the Parishes where the Offences are or shall be committed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as by the same Statute is limited and appointed.</p>
            <p>And therefore We do hereby strictly charge and command all manner of persons liuing in Our said Kingdome of England and Dominion of Wales, to be conformable in all things vnto Our Royall will and pleasure in Our said letters Patents mentioned and contained. And to the end Our said seruant, his Assignes and Deputies may the more readily and sincerely performe the trust in them reposed: We do hereby grant, publish, and declare, that Our said Seruant, his Assignes and Deputies, and euery of them shall be hereafter exempted and freed from bearing any other office or charge in the Parishes where he and they shall dwell, during the time that they shall be imployed in this seruice, to the end that they may the better looke to the execution of the foresaid Statute, in regard the same so highly tendeth to the aduancement of piety, and reliefe of the poore.</p>
            <p>And We doe hereby require and command all our Iustices, Iustices of peace, Maiors, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffes, Magistrates, Bafliffes, Constables, Church wardens, Ouerseers of the poore, and all other Our Officers, Ministers, and Subiects, within Our said Kingdome and Dominion of Wales, to whom it shall appertaine, to be aiding, helping, and assisting to Our said Seruant, his Assignes and Deputies, in all things concerning the Premises, as they tender Our pleasure, and will auoid the contrary at their vttermost perils.</p>
